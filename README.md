This is a personal just-for-fun project for learning [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) game engine. Basically I just try to implement many games from [Peak](http://www.peak.net/), a mobile "brain training" app.

## Dependencies

The following libraries were used:

- [Middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass) for OOP.
- [Stateful](https://github.com/kikito/stateful.lua) for game state management.
- [SUIT](https://github.com/vrld/SUIT) for game GUI.
- [cron](https://github.com/kikito/cron.lua) for time-related functions

## Contributing

I welcome contributions! Please feel free to open pull requests for bug fixes, or if you are feeling confident, a complete game.
